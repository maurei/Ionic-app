# Random Act of Kindness Mobile

A simple CRUD application aimed at assisting those who wish to perform more random acts of kindness by assigning them kind and actionable tasks. Users can subscribe to a subset of kind tasks belonging to various categories, and can alter the completion state of assignments which moves them to a personal archive.

This repository contains the Ionic application that consumes the API that can be found [here](https://github.com/maurei/Random-Acts-of-Kindness). I am fully responsible for the codebase and have strongly influenced the design. 

I plan to add detailed screenshots tomorrow or the day after.
